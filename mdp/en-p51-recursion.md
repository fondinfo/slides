# Recursion
## Introduction to Programming

# üí°Ô∏è Recursive Programming

- Many languages allow a function (or procedure) to call itself
- Direct or indirect recursive call

`$$\begin{cases}0! = 1 \\ n! = n \cdot (n-1)!, n>0\end{cases}$$` ![](http://fondinfo.github.io/images/fun/stack.svg)
# ‚≠ê Factorial, recursion

¬ß py
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        result = 1
    else:
        result = n * factorial(n - 1)
    return result

¬ß

- At each invocation of a function, a new record is created on the **stack**
- **Local context** to the particular activation of the function itself
- Execute with the *Thonny* debugger

# üí°Ô∏è Thinking Recursively

- ‚ë† Find some *base case*
    - Result obtained without recursion
- ‚ë° Find a solution in the *general case*
    - Requires solving a problem of the same type
    - But of reduced size
- Thus, increasingly smaller problems are solved
    - Getting closer and closer to the base case
    - Recursion terminates

# ‚≠ê Binary Tree

- A tree is a data structure, in which each node can have "children" nodes
- A *binary* tree has at most two children
- Recursive definition:
    - Base case: empty tree (no nodes)
    - General case: a node (value) + two children (subtrees)

---

# üß™ Tree (node) class

¬ß py
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
¬ß

- Each `Node` can contain any value
- `left` and `right` fields point to other `Node` objects
    - Or to `None` if they are empty

---

# üß™ Creating a tree

- A small example of a binary tree
- Built explicitly, without using a complex algorithm
- It is a balanced tree
    - On level 0: one node
    - On level 1: two nodes
    - On level 2: four nodes

¬ß py
# Nodes on the last level (leaves)
n7 = Node(7)
n4 = Node(4)
n2 = Node(2)
n6 = Node(6)

# Nodes on the intermediate level
n3 = Node(3, n2, n4)
n5 = Node(5, n6, n7)

# Root node
root = Node(1, n3, n5)
¬ß

---

# ‚≠ê Traversing a tree

- How can we access all the nodes of a tree?
- Using a *recursive algorithm*
- It passes from the current node...
    - To its left child, then recursively to its children
    - To its right child, then recursively to its children
- The depth of the recursion is the height of the tree

---

# üß™ Printing a tree

¬ß py
class Node:  # ‚Ä¶
    def print_tree(self):
        if self.left is not None:
            self.left.print_tree()
        print(self.value, end=" ")
        if self.right is not None:
            self.right.print_tree()

root.print_tree()
¬ß

- This traversal method is called *inorder*
    - First left subtree, then root, then right subtree
- The result of the print is the *sorted sequence* of values
    - If it is a Binary Search Tree (BST)
        - Values in left subtree < root < values in right subtree

---

# üß™ Summing values

- How to sum all values in a tree?
- Sum of `root.value` + sum of `left_subtree` + sum of `right_subtree`

¬ß py
class Node:  # ‚Ä¶
    def sum_values(self) -> int:
        s = self.value
        if self.left is not None:
            s += self.left.sum_values()
        if self.right is not None:
            s += self.right.sum_values()
        return s

print(root.sum_values())  # 28
¬ß

---

# üß™ Tree height

- Maximum level reachable from the root
- How to calculate it?
    - If the node is a leaf (no children), its height is 1
    - Otherwise, it is 1 + maximum height of children

¬ß py
class Node:  # ‚Ä¶
    def height(self) -> int:
        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            return 1
        h_left, h_right = 0, 0
        if self.left is not None:
            h_left = self.left.height()
        if self.right is not None:
            h_right = self.right.height()
        return 1 + max(h_left, h_right)

print(root.height())  # 3
¬ß

---

# üß™ Is the tree balanced?

- A tree is balanced if, for each node, the heights of its subtrees differ by at most 1
    - And its subtrees are themselves balanced
- The `is_balanced` method, if defined on the `Node` class, returns a `bool`

¬ß py
class Node:  # ‚Ä¶
    def is_balanced(self) -> bool:
        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            return True
        h_left, h_right = 0, 0
        if self.left is not None:
            h_left = self.left.height()
        if self.right is not None:
            h_right = self.right.height()
        return abs(h_left - h_right) <= 1 and \
               (self.left is None or self.left.is_balanced()) and \
               (self.right is None or self.right.is_balanced())

# Fibonacci, recursive

- Implement `fibonacci(n)`
    - If `n` is 0 or 1, the result is `n`
    - Otherwise, `fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)`

# Expression evaluation

- Define an abstract base class `Expression`
    - With an abstract method `eval`
- Then define concrete subclasses, derived from `Expression`
    - **`Literal`**, containing a single number (value)
    - **`Sum`**, containing two operands, both expressions
    - **`Product`**, containing two operands, both expressions
- Instantiate (without *parsing*!) objects to represent this expression:
    - `5 * (3 * 2 + 4)`
- Calculate the final value, calling `eval` on the root node
