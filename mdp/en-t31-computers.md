# ‚≠ê Central Processing Unit

- CPU: ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the computer
    - Executes programs
    - Controls other parts of the computer
- Composed of two parts:
    - **Control Unit (CU)**: interprets instructions, commands other parts of the CPU, controls flow between CPU and memory
    - **Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)**: performs arithmetic and logical operations, performs data comparisons

# üî¨ Synchronous Logic Circuits

- Switching delay of logic gates
    - `0‚Üí1 / 1‚Üí0` transition
    - Signal transition ‚â† step
    - Delay, overshooting, ringing
    - Due to parasitic capacitances and inductances
- *Clock* regulates the entire circuit
    - Time to stabilize all signals

---

# ‚≠ê Main CPU Cycle

- **Fetch**: CU retrieves the instruction from the memory location indicated by the PC (Program Counter) register and stores it in the IR (Instruction Register)
- **Decode**: CU interprets the instruction, optionally reads necessary data from memory
- **Execute**: CU commands the parts
- **Store**: results stored in main memory or CPU registers

# üî¨ Instruction Fetch

![large](http://fondinfo.github.io/images/sys/cpu-fetch.svg)

---

# üî¨ Instruction Interpretation

- At the end of the *fetch* phase, IR contains the instruction to be executed
    - **Opcode + operands**
    - *Machine language*: meaning depends on the CPU
- In the example: **`5`** `012$_{hex}$` = **`0101`** `0000 0001 0010$_{bin}$`
    - Opcode = **`0101$_{bin}$`**
    - E.g. Read a word from the accumulator register...
    - And store it in a memory address (operand)

# ‚≠ê PC Architecture

![small](http://fondinfo.github.io/images/sys/motherboard-example.jpg)

- *Northbridge*, now integrated into the CPU
    - Graphics & Memory Controller Hub (GMCH) : ~ 50 GB/s
- *Southbridge*, or ‚Äúchipset‚Äù
    - Disks and I/O peripherals : ~ 500 MB/s

# ‚≠ê Flynn's Classification

- **Parallelism**: ‚Üë performance, with same speed per single instruction
    - S/M: single/multiple
    - I/D: instruction/data
- *SISD*: one operation at a time; traditional single-processor and core machines
- *MISD*: unusual, for fault tolerance; heterogeneous systems, on the same data, must yield the same results
- *SIMD*: naturally parallelizable operations; vector computing units and GPUs
- *MIMD*: different instructions on different data; architectures with multiple cores or autonomous processors, distributed systems

---

# ‚≠ê Assembler

- **Machine language**: defines the instruction set understandable by the CPU
    - *CISC*: Complex Instruction Set Computing
    - *RISC*: Reduced Instruction Set Computing
- Assembler: translates from **assembly language** (mnemonic) to machine language (1~1 mapping)
- Ex. *x86 Assembly* ‚Üí machine (variable-length instructions)

``` asm
MOV AH, 11 ‚Üí 1011 0 100 00001011
```

- 4 bits for op-code (`1011`), instruction type
- `w` bit (`0`): 8-bit or 16-bit operation, (0 or 1 resp.)
- 3 bits for destination register (`100`)
- 8 bits of data for operand: `11$_{dec}$` = `00001011$_{bin}$`
